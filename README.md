# Quick Tutorial for the CARTO BigQuery Tiler
Hello, world! This is a tutorial on using the CARTO BigQuery Tiler with some basic visualizations. This will get you started on accessing tilesets in a couple different tools to help you learn some of the fundamentals.

## Read me first!
Few important notes before we begin.
- This is demonstration code that is meant to be used to learn, and isn't necessarily for use in production. It's not a supported product, so things may change and break over time, so we'll try to fix it when we can!
- This uses [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) which can incur costs. Be sure to understand how costs will be incurred to your project through the [pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing), and be sure to understand the [Google Cloud Trial and Free Tiers](https://cloud.google.com/free) as well.
- This also uses the CARTO BigQuery Tiler. You need to be a part of the beta for this to work. Find more information on this [here](https://carto.com/bigquery/beta/).

The queries will be added to this repository shortly after the presentation at SDSC 20!
